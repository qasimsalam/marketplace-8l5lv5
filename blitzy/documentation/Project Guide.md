## Key Design Patterns

The project implements several key design patterns:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Backend functionality is divided into specialized services that communicate via API Gateway.

2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access is abstracted through repository interfaces in services.

3. **Redux State Management**: Client applications use Redux Toolkit for predictable state management.

4. **Dependency Injection**: Services use dependency injection for better testability and modularity.

5. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating service instances like AI models and database connections.

6. **Observer Pattern**: Implemented through WebSockets for real-time collaboration features.

7. **Command Pattern**: Used in the job matching and proposal systems.

8. **Strategy Pattern**: Applied in payment processing and authentication mechanisms.

This modular architecture enables independent development and scaling of different components while maintaining a cohesive user experience across platforms.

## 2. Code Standards and Style Guidelines

### 2.1 General Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't implement features until needed
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one reason to change
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate business logic from presentation

### 2.2 TypeScript/JavaScript Guidelines

```typescript
// Use explicit typing
function calculateTotal(items: CartItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}

// Use interfaces for object shapes
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Use enums for fixed sets of values
enum UserRole {
  CLIENT = 'client',
  PROFESSIONAL = 'professional',
  ADMIN = 'admin',
}

// Use async/await for asynchronous code
async function fetchUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    handleApiError(error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Python Guidelines

```python
# Use type hints
def calculate_match_score(job_skills: List[str], user_skills: List[str]) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the match score between job requirements and user skills.
    
    Args:
        job_skills: List of skills required for the job
        user_skills: List of skills the user possesses
        
    Returns:
        A float between 0 and 1 representing the match percentage
    """
    if not job_skills:
        return 0.0
        
    matching_skills = set(job_skills).intersection(set(user_skills))
    return len(matching_skills) / len(job_skills)
```

### 2.4 Code Formatting and Linting

| Component | Tools | Command |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | ESLint, Prettier | `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format` |
| Python | pylint, black | `pylint ./**/*.py`, `black .` |
| React/JSX | ESLint React plugin | Included in `pnpm lint` |

### 2.5 Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Files | kebab-case | `user-profile.tsx` |
| Components | PascalCase | `UserProfile` |
| Functions | camelCase | `getUserData()` |
| Variables | camelCase | `userData` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_FILE_SIZE` |
| Interfaces/Types | PascalCase | `UserProfile` |
| CSS Classes | kebab-case | `user-avatar` |
| Database Tables | snake_case | `user_profiles` |
| API Endpoints | kebab-case | `/api/v1/user-profiles` |

## 3. Git Workflow and Contribution Guidelines

- Bug fix branches: `fix/bug-description`
- Release branches: `release/version-number`

### 3.2 Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements

| E2E Tests | Cypress, Detox | Key user flows |
| API Tests | Postman, Supertest | All endpoints |
| Performance Tests | k6, Lighthouse | Critical paths |

### 4.2 Writing Effective Tests

```typescript
// Unit test example (Jest)
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('validatePassword', () => {
    it('should return true for valid password', () => {
      const password = 'ValidP@ss123';
      const result = UserService.validatePassword(password);
      expect(result).toBe(true);
    });

    it('should return false for password without uppercase', () => {
      const password = 'invalidp@ss123';
      const result = UserService.validatePassword(password);
      expect(result).toBe(false);
    });
    
    // More test cases...
  });
});
```

```python
# Python test example (pytest)
def test_calculate_match_score_with_matching_skills():
    job_skills = ["python", "machine_learning", "tensorflow"]
    user_skills = ["python", "tensorflow", "pytorch"]
    
    result = calculate_match_score(job_skills, user_skills)
    
    assert result == 2/3  # 2 matching skills out of 3 job skills
```

### 4.3 Test Automation

All tests are automatically run in the CI pipeline:

- On pull requests: Unit and integration tests

# Apply migrations
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

### 5.2 Database Design Principles

- Use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity
- Create indexes for frequently queried columns
- Use appropriate data types for columns
- Implement soft deletes where appropriate
- Follow naming conventions consistently

### 5.3 Query Optimization

- Document breaking changes between versions

### 6.3 Error Handling

```typescript
// Standard error response format
interface ErrorResponse {
  status: number;
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details?: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp: string;
}

// Example error response
{
  "status": 400,
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Invalid input data",
  "details": {
    "email": "Must be a valid email address"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-07-25T14:30:45Z"
}
```
