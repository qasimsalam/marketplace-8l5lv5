## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.11 or higher)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Git**
- **npm** or **pnpm** (v8 or higher)

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-talent-marketplace/platform.git
   cd platform
   ```

2. Create environment files:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   pnpm install
   
   # Install service-specific dependencies
   pnpm run bootstrap
   ```

### Running with Docker Compose

For local development with all services:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start all services, including databases and the API gateway. The web application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Running Individual Services

To run specific services for development:

```bash
# Start the web application
cd src/web
pnpm dev

# Start the API gateway
cd src/backend/api-gateway
pnpm dev

# Start a specific microservice (e.g., user-service)
cd src/backend/user-service
pnpm dev
```

### Database Setup

The platform uses multiple databases. For local development, Docker Compose will set these up automatically. To initialize the databases with seed data:

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Port conflicts**: Check if the required ports (3000, 4000, 5432, 27017, 6379, 9200) are available
- **Database connection issues**: Ensure Docker containers are running properly
- **Environment variables**: Verify all required variables are set in the `.env` file

## Development Guidelines

### Development Workflow

We follow a GitHub Flow workflow:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -am "Add feature X"`
3. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. Open a Pull Request against `main`
5. After review and approval, merge into `main`

### Code Style and Linting

We use ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### Testing

Each component should have unit and integration tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for a specific service
cd src/backend/user-service
pnpm test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Database Migrations

For schema changes:

```bash
# Create a new migration
cd src/backend/service-name
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name migration-name

# Apply migrations
pnpm prisma migrate deploy
```

### Adding a New Service

1. Create a new directory in `src/backend/`
2. Initialize with the service template: `pnpm run generate:service my-service-name`
3. Implement the service following the established patterns
4. Add the service to `docker-compose.yml` and Kubernetes manifests

## Deployment Instructions

### Containerization

All services are containerized using Docker:

```bash
# Build all Docker images
pnpm run docker:build

# Build a specific service image
pnpm run docker:build --service=user-service
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

The platform is deployed to Kubernetes using ArgoCD:

1. Apply the base configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/base
   ```

2. Apply the environment-specific configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/environments/production
   ```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions workflows handle:

1. Building and testing on all PRs
2. Building and pushing Docker images on merge to `main`
3. Deploying to development environment on merge to `main`
4. Deploying to staging/production after manual approval

### Environment Configuration

Environment-specific configurations are managed through:

1. Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets
2. AWS Parameter Store for sensitive values
3. Environment-specific Terraform variables

### Monitoring and Observability

After deployment, monitor the application using:

- **Grafana dashboards**: For metrics visualization
- **Kibana**: For log analysis
- **Prometheus alerts**: For notification of issues

## API Documentation

### API Overview

The platform provides a comprehensive set of APIs for all functionality:

- REST API for most service interactions
- GraphQL API for complex data fetching
- WebSocket API for real-time features

APIs are secured using JWT authentication:

```bash
# Example authentication request
curl -X POST https://api.aitalentmarketplace.com/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}'
